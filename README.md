- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MnMrulz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in doing various coding projects and creating mini projects in collaboration. I'm originally a physics major
      so most of my project work is based on that, but I'm also interested in CS and Data Science!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Algorithms in python while dabbling in a few other languages like Ada, Ruby, Matlab, etc.
- ðŸ“« If there are any problrms or issues you face while running my codes, you can reach me via mail or comments.
